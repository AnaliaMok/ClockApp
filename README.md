# ClockApp

A Simple electron.js Clock App. Since Windows does not have simple clock to bring up, 
I decided to create my own while playing around with electron. This project displays the current date, standard time,
and the military time. Off to the left is a list of events that are occurring on the current day.

__NOTE__: This repository does not have the dependencies to run the app. You will need use npm to install electron and 
possibly electron-reload if you want to play around with this code.
